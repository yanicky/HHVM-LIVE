# HHVM-LIVE
Config Files for creating Live-build bootable ISO for HHVM

### Requirement

While it's probably possible to build on other configuration, HHVM is not yet supported on Debian(buster) so this live-build configuration is designed for building HHVM-LIVE on Debian(stretch) and require live-build to be installed.

use the following commands in the base directory to build the iso


```lb config; sudo lb clean; sudo lb build;```
